# INFO 340 Project

This repository contains proposal for an interactive information web app, created for the _Client-Side Web Development_ course at the UW iSchool. The final deliverable is hopefully a protest hub where users are able to view, sort, find, and learn about protests around the United States. Details of this plan can be found in `proposal.html`.
