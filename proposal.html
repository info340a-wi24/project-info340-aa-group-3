                <p>
                    Over time, people have turned to revolts, movements, and protests as a means of advocating for social change. 
                    With the rise of social media in the modern era, diverse groups of people are increasingly connected with issues 
                    across the globe, as half a million people attended Black Lives Matter protests on June 6th, 2020 
                <cite><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/03/us/george-floyd-protests-crowd-size.html">(Buchanan et al., 2020)</a></cite>. 
                    In response to these shifts in the availability of information, apps such as Instagram have worked to expand journalism 
                    efforts through features for fundraising, geotags and hashtags, and story posts to rapidly spread information. With the 
                    virality of social media, large masses of people can successfully gather and be reached through activist accounts with 
                    calls to action.

                    While this is helpful, no centralized platform exists to personalize the process of protest involvement. For issues 
                    that are smaller in scale, hosted by lesser-known organizations, or in less metropolitan areas, coverage becomes 
                    increasingly difficult. Particularly for individuals whose personalized content and social circles fail to include 
                    current events, it is difficult to consistently organize in cohesive ways or discover events that perfectly align 
                    with one’s preferences. Furthermore, in response to the popularity of protests over social media, many governmental 
                    officials are banning social media or utilizing the platforms to infringe on the privacy of citizens 
                    <cite><a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/how-governments-go-after-protesters-using-social-media/">(Cortés, 2021)</a></cite>. 
                    To better empower the public to speak up in meaningful ways, a new solution is required.

                <!--interactive features-->
                <p>
                    To address the following problem space, we propose the following features for a new Protest Hub application: 
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Protest Search Function</li>
                    <li>Protest RSVP Forms </li>
                    <li>Protest Map Exploration Tool</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    When users navigate to our site, they will have a chance to utilize a primary search function, which includes 
                    various filters and tags to narrow down to one’s preferred set of protest recommendations. Similar to discovery 
                    apps such as Yelp, users can enter keywords on preferences such as location, cause, and organization. 
                    Additionally, subcategories for filtering will be provided via checkboxes and listed options, such as date and 
                    time ranges, or number of attendees. Based on the user preferences provided, the application will provide a list 
                    of matching protests for users to learn more about and RSVP for. For this feature, the click of a button will 
                    present users with a form to collect information on their name and email, effectively adding them to the list of 
                    attendees. After filling out the form, users will be notified via email about their successful RSVP. Lastly, for 
                    users who are interested in broader exploration, a map exploration tool can be accessed to discover a variety of 
                    protests across the U.S. By zooming in and out within the map, as well as clicking on 
                    relevant protest location pins, users can quickly discover events close by and become exposed to a greater variety 
                    of protest topics in a shortened form.

                <!--information and data needed-->
                <p>
                    To provide relevant information regarding protest events, external research is necessary to find real-time 
                    logs of protest events across the United States Various datasets are available for worldwide historical data, or protest 
                    events by category, which may require us to filter down to our specific domain of U.S. protests and combine across multiple 
                    sources. Organizations such as the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace provide spreadsheets and visualization tools 
                    for such data, found <a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/publications/interactive/protest-tracker">here</a>. Approaches 
                    through APIs may also be relevant, such as keyword trackers and geotags through Instagram or Twitter live data, yet access 
                    to these is often restricted or costly. An example of this can be found <a href="https://usprotests.liveuamap.com">here</a>. 
                    Given this difficulty of accessing current data, we may have to manually collect data, create dummy datasets, or mimic 
                    functionality through historic protest information. To handle user input, some functionality must be introduced that allows for 
                    the tracking of providing emails in a spreadsheet that can then correspond to notification messages that are sent out through 
                    our application.

                <p>
                    This Protest Hub is meant to be used by anyone who wants to bring attention to any existing issues and those who 
                    want to discover protests happening in their area. The included past protests will also give people insight into the 
                    issues that are going on. With this, we hope that minority groups canhave a stronger voice and that protests 
                    can reach more people who are in the area. Users will also have an easier time organizing and preparing for the 
                    protests that they plan to participate in. In doing so, people who work long hours will be able to attend and contribute 
                    to the protests that mean a lot to them. By creating this centralized platform that has all the information about both 
                    current and past protests, people who care about the same issues will have a place to find others with the same views as 
                    themselves. It will also be useful to gauge the size of the protest using the RSVP information. Preemptively knowing the 
                    estimated size of the protest can help organizers determine whether they need more advertising. Other users may also feel 
                    more inclined to participate in a protest that is likely to have more attendance as numbers will ensure a greater impact made 
                    because of the event.
