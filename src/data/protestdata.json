As Israel and the US threaten Rafah with invasion, the time is now to mobilize! No amount of repression and intimidation will stop us.

    "description": "Starbucks is contributing over 16 million tons of carbon into our atmosphere every year. Over 1/5, or 3.52 million, comes from dairy milk alone. That's twice as much as their coffee and four times as much as their packaging! They continue to present themselves as a forward conscious company, committing to sustainability goals. We need to show them we see through their green-washing manipulation tactics and won't allow baby cows to be murdered for lattes and frappuccinos. We need accessibility to veganism for everyone in order to prevent unnecessary cruelty to animals and destruction to our planet. Starbucks already offers non-dairy milk for the same cost as cow's milk in the UK, France and Germany. When much smaller chains like Stumptown Coffee can offer oat milk as their default milk, massive Starbucks can afford to do what's right for the environment, animals and Americans.",

Getting them to report would be a big win: they have over 31,700 restaurants worldwide. We're targeting Jimmy John's as part of a national pressure campaign. Come join us as we hold signs and talk to patron and employees about why its important that Jimmy John's (and Inspire Brands generally) report progress against their promise to phase out cruel cages for hens.",
