                        Over time, people have turned to revolts, movements, and protests as a means of advocating for social change. 
                        With the rise of social media in the modern era, diverse groups of people are increasingly connected with issues 
                        across the globe, as half a million people attended Black Lives Matter protests on June 6th, 2020 
                        <cite><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/03/us/george-floyd-protests-crowd-size.html">(Buchanan et al., 2020)</a></cite>. 
                        In response to these shifts in the availability of information, apps such as Instagram have worked to expand journalism 
                        efforts through features for fundraising, geotags and hashtags, and story posts to rapidly spread information. With the 
                        virality of social media, large masses of people can successfully gather and be reached through activist accounts with 
                        calls to action.

                        While this is helpful, no centralized platform exists to personalize the process of protest involvement. For issues 
                        that are smaller in scale, hosted by lesser-known organizations, or in less metropolitan areas, coverage becomes 
                        increasingly difficult. Particularly for individuals whose personalized content and social circles fail to include 
                        current events, it is difficult to consistently organize in cohesive ways or discover events that perfectly align 
                        with one’s preferences. Furthermore, in response to the popularity of protests over social media, many governmental 
                        officials are banning social media or utilizing the platforms to infringe on the privacy of citizens 
                        <cite><a target="_blank" href="https://restofworld.org/2021/how-governments-go-after-protesters-using-social-media/">(Cortés, 2021)</a></cite>. 
                        To better empower the public to speak up in meaningful ways, a new solution is required.
